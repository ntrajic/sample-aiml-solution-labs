    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This optional lab demonstrates how to add fine-grained authorization to your AgentCore Gateway using Cedar policies. You'll learn to restrict tool access based on conditions, implementing principle of least privilege.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create an AgentCore Policy Engine\n",
    "- Write Cedar policies for conditional access control\n",
    "- Attach policies to enforce authorization rules\n",
    "- Test policy enforcement\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Completed 2 (AgentCore Identity)\n",
    "- Completed 3 (AgentCore Gateway)\n",
    "- Gateway must be created and accessible\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Gateway Policies?\n",
    "\n",
    "Without policies, any authenticated user can access all gateway tools. Policies enable:\n",
    "- Conditional authorization based on request parameters\n",
    "- Role-based access control\n",
    "- Fine-grained permission management\n",

    "You've successfully implemented fine-grained authorization using Cedar policies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created a Policy Engine to contain authorization rules\n",
    "- Generated Cedar policies from natural language descriptions\n",
    "- Attached policies to enforce scope-based access control\n",
    "- Tested policy enforcement with different OAuth scopes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Write scope (`workshop-api/write`) grants access to approve tool only\n",
    "- Read scope (`workshop-api/read`) grants access to create and list tools only\n",
    "- Cedar policies provide fine-grained, declarative authorization\n",
    "- Policy enforcement happens at the gateway level, outside application code\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **8: Streamlit Frontend (OPTIONAL)** - Build a customer-facing application\n",
    "- **9: Cleanup Resources** - Remove all resources created in this workshop"
