    "**What you'll learn:** How Memory enables personalized interactions through Short-Term (conversation context) and Long-Term (persistent facts/preferences) storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it matters:** Memory transforms stateless agents into context-aware assistants. Three strategies (USER_PREFERENCE, SEMANTIC, SUMMARY) automatically extract and organize information for future retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world value:** Agents remember customer preferences, past issues, and conversation history—enabling continuity across sessions without manual context passing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Like a doctor's patient file: recent visit notes (short-term), medical history and allergies (long-term facts), and visit summaries (long-term summaries).\n",
