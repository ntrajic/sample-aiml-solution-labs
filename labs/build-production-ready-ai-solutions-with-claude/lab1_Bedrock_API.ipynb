        "# Amazon Bedrock Workshop: Getting Started with Amazon Bedrock APIs using Claude Sonnet 3.7\n",
        "\n",
        "Welcome to this hands-on workshop where you'll learn how to interact with Amazon Bedrock APIs using Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 3.7 model. \n",

        "## What is Amazon Bedrock?\n",
        "\n",
        "[Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/) is a comprehensive, secure, and flexible service for building generative AI applications and agents. Amazon Bedrock connects you to leading foundation models (FMs), services to deploy and operate agents, and tools for fine-tuning, safeguarding, and optimizing models along with knowledge bases to connect applications to your latest data so that you have everything you need to quickly move from experimentation to real-world deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Benefits:\n",
        "- **Easy Integration**: Single API to access multiple foundation models\n",
        "- **Serverless**: No infrastructure to manage\n",
        "- **Security**: Your data stays within your AWS account\n",
        "- **Scalability**: Automatically scales based on demand\n",

        "[Claude](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/about-claude/models/overview) is a family of state-of-the-art large language models developed by Anthropic. This guide introduces our models and compares their performance with legacy models.\n",
