    "## Foundational Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Models are trained (pretraining) on massive text datasets - books, articles, websites, code repositories - containing billions of words. This allows the model to predict the next word in a sequence. For instance, after seeing \"The cat sat on the...\" thousands of times, it learns \"mat\" is a likely next word.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a model is pretrained, it can predict the next work in sequence. However, this raw capability isn't immediately useful for specific tasks. A pretrained model might continue \"Write a summary of this article\" with random web text rather than actually summarizing. This is where adaptation comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task-Specific Adaptation involves additional training to teach the model how to respond appropriately to different types of requests:\n",
    "\n",
    "• **Instruction Following**: Training on examples where humans give commands and provide the desired responses, teaching the model to recognize \"Write a summary\" as an instruction rather than text to continue  \n",
    "• **Question Answering**: Fine-tuning on question-answer pairs to learn how to provide direct, relevant answers  \n",
    "• **Code Generation**: Training on programming examples to understand when to write code versus explain concepts  \n",
    "• **Conversational Behavior**: Learning to engage in helpful dialogue rather than just predicting likely next words  \n",
    "\n",
    "This adaptation transforms a general text predictor into a model that can understand your intent and perform specific tasks based on your prompts."
