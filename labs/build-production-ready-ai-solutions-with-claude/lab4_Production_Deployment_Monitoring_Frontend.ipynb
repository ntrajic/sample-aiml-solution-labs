    "## Lab 4: Deploy to Production - Use AgentCore Runtime with Observability and a Frontend Application\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In Lab 3 we designed robust architectures with Retrieval Augemented Generation (RAG), Agentic AI using Strands and security with Guardrails. In this Lab, we will see how to deploy an Agent to production using AgentCore Runtime with secure authentication, memory and comprehensive observability. This will transform our prototype into a production-ready system that can handle real-world traffic with full monitoring and automatic scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/agents-tools-runtime.html) is a secure, fully managed runtime that empowers organizations to deploy and scale AI agents in production, regardless of framework, protocol, or model choice. It provides enterprise-grade reliability, automatic scaling, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Workshop Journey:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lab 1 (Done):** Getting Started with Bedrock APIs - Learned basic API calls, streaming responses, and conversational interactions using Claude Haiku 4.5\n",
    "- **Lab 2 (Done):** Prompt Engineering - Mastered system prompts, structured output, zero-shot/few-shot prompting, and chain-of-thought reasoning\n",
    "- **Lab 3 (Done):** Enterprise Bedrock Architectures with Claude Models - Built RAG with Knowledge Base, implemented Agentic AI using Strands framework, and configured security with Guardrails\n",
    "- **Lab 4 (Current):** Production Deployment with Monitoring & Frontend - Deploy agents to production using AgentCore Runtime with comprehensive observability, secure authentication with Cognito, and create a customer-facing Streamlit frontend application\n",
    "- **Lab 5:** Cost Optimization - Implement dynamic model selection with prompt routing, optimize prompts and outputs, leverage caching strategies, and use batch processing for non-real-time scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why AgentCore Runtime & Production Deployment Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "Current State: Agent runs locally with centralized tools but faces production challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- No comprehensive monitoring or debugging capabilities\n",
    "- The agents cannot scale in or out automatically as traffic increases or decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this lab, we will have a production-ready agent infrastructure with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Serverless auto-scaling to handle variable demand\n",
    "- Comprehensive observability with traces, metrics, and logging\n",
    "- Enterprise reliability with automatic error recovery\n",
    "- Secure deployment with proper access controls\n",
    "- Easy management through AWS console and APIs and support for real-world production workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding comprehensive observability with AgentCore Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, AgentCore Runtime integrates seamlessly with [AgentCore Observability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock-agentcore/latest/devguide/observability.html) to provide full visibility into your agent's behavior in production. AgentCore Observability automatically captures traces, metrics, and logs from your agent interactions, tool usage, and memory access patterns. In this lab we will see how AgentCore Runtime integrates with CloudWatch GenAI Observability to provide comprehensive monitoring and debugging capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "For request tracing, AgentCore Observability captures the complete conversation flow including tool invocations, memory retrievals, and model interactions. For performance monitoring, it tracks response times, success rates, and resource utilization to help optimize your agent's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the observability flow, AgentCore Runtime automatically instruments your agent code and sends telemetry data to CloudWatch. You can then use CloudWatch dashboards and GenAI Observability features to analyze patterns, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture for Lab 4\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:left\"> \n",
    "    <img src=\"images/lab4_architecture_runtime.png\" width=\"75%\"/> \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Agent now runs in AgentCore Runtime with full observability through CloudWatch, serving production traffic with auto-scaling and comprehensive monitoring.AgentCore Memory enables the AI agent to maintain context over time, remember important facts, and deliver consistent, personalized experiences.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Serverless Agent Deployment:** Transform your local agent into a scalable production service using AgentCore Runtime with minimal code changes\n",
    "- **Comprehensive Observability:** Full request tracing, performance metrics, and debugging capabilities through CloudWatch GenAI Observability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.12+\n",
    "- AWS account with appropriate permissions\n",
    "- Docker, Finch or Podman installed and running\n",
    "- Amazon Bedrock AgentCore SDK\n",
