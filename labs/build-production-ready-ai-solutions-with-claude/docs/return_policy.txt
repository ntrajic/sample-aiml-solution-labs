Amazon Return Policy
Easy shopping, simple returns - that's our promise. At Amazon, we're committed to making your shopping experience as seamless and worry-free as possible. We understand that there may be times when a purchase may not meet your expectations or your needs might change. When that happens, we make completing a return simple and convenient.

Most items can be returned for a refund or replacement/exchange within 30 days of delivery as long as they are in original or unused condition. For eligible items, you can enjoy free returns at many locations near you. For information on an item's return eligibility, please check the product detail page before placing your order. After placing an order, you can find relevant information on an item's return eligibility in your Order History.

A refund will be provided if Amazon (or the third-party seller) has received the item, and determined that you are eligible for a refund. It can take up to 30 days for us to receive and process your return. In certain circumstances refund timeframes may be longer. If we need additional information about your return, we will notify you with instructions to contact Customer Service. For more information, please see our Refunds page.
