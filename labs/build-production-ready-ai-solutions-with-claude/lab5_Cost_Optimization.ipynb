    "# Agents Cost Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will look various techniques including to optimize running Agentic AI Applications in Production for Enterprise Applications. The key components of cost in an Agentic AI application are 1) Inference Cost largely driven by the token count (in case of on-demand models) and model size (in case custom models or fine-tuned models.) 2) Knowledge Base - cost of ingesting the data and synchronizing the changes and cost of retrieving the context from the knowledgebase 3) Tool Calls - compute cost for executing the tools and the wait times associated or cost of the API if they are external 4) Invovation Cost - the compute involved in handling the requests from the users or the batch compute or the event triggering mechanisms.\n",
